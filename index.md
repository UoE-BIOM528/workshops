# BIOM528 Genomics of plant pathogens

In these workshops we will be working through an example research project looking at the genomics of the fungus, *Zymoseptoria tritici*, an important pathogen of wheat. You will be introduced to several bioinformatics analyses to process raw biological data and make discoveries that can inform our understanding of the pathogen and generate hypotheses for new lab-based experiments.
